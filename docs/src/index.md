# teqqys Home Assistant configuration

This [git repo]() is my [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) configuration.

This allows me to:

* Version control my changes, allowing easy rollback of breaking patches/tinkering/etc
* Allow for easy reinstall/disaster recovery of a cluster, as everything *except* persistent data is defined here.
