## Z-Wave
At the beginning of my smart home journey i used a lot Z-Wave products. Mostly because zigbee where quite unreliable and there where no generic zigbee coordinator. 
Now i still use some Z-Wave components, but i try to slowly fade out.

## Zigbee
As i mention, i try to just use zigbee devices. Its easier for me to just maintain just one network. Maybe zigbee devices will be replaces with [Matter](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_(Standard)) devices in the near future.
