## Home Assistant
Home Assistant is running in my [Kubernetes Cluster](https://github.com/cbirkenbeul/k3s-gitops) as a Container. I use the official Home Assistant container for that. 
Most of my config i edit in the side-car container [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) directly in the browser. Thats makes it easier for me to deploy new configs.
